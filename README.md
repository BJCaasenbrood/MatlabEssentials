# Matlab Essentials
Matlab Essentials is an attempt to fill the gaps of standard function that are not included into the base installation. Some of these functions are for example `lerp`, `sigmoid`, `linespacen`, `rot2d`, `rotx`,  `random`, `randint`, `depfun`, `isodd`, `isneg` and many others. Additionally, we provide an extensive color packages with syntax `color_` and colormaps under `cmap_` (based on the matplotlib in Python).
