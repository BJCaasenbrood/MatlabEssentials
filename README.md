# MatEssentials

MatEssentials (from Matlab Essentials) is an attempt to fill the gaps of common programming functions that are not included into the base installation. Some of these functions are for example `lerp`, `sigmoid`, `linespacen`, `rot2d`, `rotx`,  `random`, `randint`, `depfun`, `isodd`, `isneg` and many others. Additionally, we provide an extensive color packages with syntax `color_` and colormaps under `cmap_` (based on the matplotlib in Python).

## Installation
We highly recommend installing the essentials package using the [Matlab Package Manager](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54548-mpm?s_tid=srchtitle) (MPM), which can be easily installed via the Matlab Add-On Mananger ![](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-ons_24x24.png). Once MPM is installed, the essential package can be installed by the following command in the Matlab command window

```bash
mpm install matessentials --all-paths
```

This will generate a folder under `MATLAB Add-Ons/Collections/mpm/mobeets-mpm-c626429/mpm-packages/matessentials/`.

## Improved Matlab colors
The package comes with an improved color pallete for plotting. To set and fix the colororder, use `set_colororder`.

To revert back to the default matlab colors, use `set_colororder(cpal_matlab)`;

## Improved Matlab colormaps
Matlab lacks many of the standard colormaps. Colormaps in the package are based on the ones from Python in the package MatPlotLib, which are given under `cmap_...`. These colormaps can also be modified using an additional input, e.g., `cmap_turbo(-1)` flips the colors, whereas `cmap_turbo(0)` mirrors the colormap.
